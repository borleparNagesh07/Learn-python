# Tuple
# These are immutable data type in python Once a tuple is created, you cannot change its contents (i.e., you cannot add, remove, or modify its items).

# Because tupples are immutable and their size is fixed at creation

# Syntax: Defined using parentheses () (though commas are the essential element, and parentheses are sometimes optional).

a = ("Nagesh","Indra",True,1,12,19,24.45)

print(a)
print(type(a))
