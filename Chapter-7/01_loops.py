# In Python, loop is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, string, or range) and execute a block of code for each item in the sequence. The loop continues until all items in the sequence have been processed.

# Write a program to print  1 to 5 using a for loop.

print(1)
print(2)
print(3)
print(4)
print(5)

# The same task can be done like this:
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(i)
