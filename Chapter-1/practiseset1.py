# prob-1 write a poem
# This is the whispers of the morning
print('''The sun peeks through the silver mist,
A golden kiss, a lover's twist.
The world awakens, soft and slow,
As rivers of light begin to flow.

The trees stretch high with arms of grace,
Their branches dance in natureâ€™s trace.
Birds sing songs of joy anew,
While dew upon the grass is blue.

The sky, a canvas, painted bright,
In shades of rose and lavender light.
A breeze, so gentle, stirs the air,
Carrying dreams beyond compare.

In this moment, pure and still,
Time seems to pause, and hearts refill.
For every dawn, a chance to find,
The peace that lives within the mind.

So let the morning whispers speak,
Of quiet strength, of being meek.
And with each step, embrace the day,
As light and love both lead the way.''')
