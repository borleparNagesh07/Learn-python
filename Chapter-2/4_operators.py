# Arithmetic Operators

a = 6

b = 3

print(a + b)

# Assignment Operators

a = 6 - 3 # Assign 6 - 3 in "a" varible

print(a)

b = 6

# b += 5 # Increment the value of b by 5 and then assign it to b

print(b)

b -= 4 # Decrement the value of b by 4 and then assign it to b

print(b)

# Comparision Operator

# d = 5 > 4 checks the right operand is greater than the right operand

# d = 5 < 4 checks the left operand is less than the right operand

# d = 5 >= 4 it checks the right operand is greater than or equal to right operand

# d = 5 <= 4 it checks the left operand is less than or equal to left operand

# d = 5 == 5 Checks if two valus are equal 

d = 5 != 4 # Checks if two valus are not equal

print(d)
